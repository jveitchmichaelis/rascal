Version 0.3.2
-------------

:Date: 23 March 2022

This version adds quite a lot of small fixes, in particular some nasty bugs in RANSAC which would return duplicate atlas lines,
or incorrect match lists. Error checking has been improved throughout with sanity checks to prevent obviously wrong fits from
sneaking through. Overall fitting should be a bit more robust. This release benefits from several real-world user reports.

We've added a contributor requirement to use pre-commit, which performs some simple linting and runs black to format code prior to commit.

There is a new Atlas class which is the new recommended way to add arc lines. The old methods are still present, but are deprecated
and will be removed in 0.4.0.

On top of bugfixes, @cylanmarco has done a lot of work to improve automated installation, CI and testing.
